It involves creating a makeup recommendation app that provides personalized suggestions based on user input. Since this requires external data (makeup products, brands, affiliate links) and potentially image analysis (selfie analysis for skin tone, etc.), I'll focus on structuring the app and setting up the basic UI elements. The core functionality of generating makeup recommendations will require integrating with an external API or service, which is beyond the scope of the current tool's capabilities. However, I can create a plan to structure the app to accommodate this functionality in the future.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1.  **Create a Profile Screen:** This screen will allow users to input their skin tone, undertone, eye color, and face shape. This information will be used to personalize the makeup recommendations.\n2.  **Create a Recommendations Screen:** This screen will display the makeup recommendations for the 5 occasions (Work, Date, Party, Wedding, Evening) in the JSON format you specified.\n3.  **Implement Navigation:** Set up navigation between the Profile screen and the Recommendations screen.\n4.  **Design Elements:** Implement a visually appealing design with a light theme.\n\nHere's the detailed plan:\n\n*   **Step 1: Create a Profile Screen**\n    *   Create a new file named `profileInput.tsx` in the `app/(tabs)` directory.\n    *   This screen will contain input fields for skin tone, undertone, eye color, and face shape.\n    *   Add a button to submit the profile information and navigate to the Recommendations screen.\n*   **Step 2: Create a Recommendations Screen**\n    *   Create a new file named `recommendations.tsx` in the `app/(tabs)` directory.\n    *   This screen will display the makeup recommendations in the JSON format you specified.\n    *   For now, the recommendations will be hardcoded. Later, this can be integrated with an external API or service.\n*   **Step 3: Implement Navigation**\n    *   Modify the `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` file to include the new `profileInput.tsx` and `recommendations.tsx` screens in the tab navigation.\n    *   Update the button on the Profile screen to navigate to the Recommendations screen when clicked.\n*   **Step 4: Design Elements**\n    *   Use a light theme for the app.\n    *   Colors:\n        *   Background: `#F5F5F5`\n        *   Text: `#212121`\n        *   TextSecondary: `#757575`\n        *   Primary: `#6200EE`\n        *   Secondary: `#03DAC5`\n        *   Accent: `#BB86FC`\n        *   Card: `#FFFFFF`\n        *   Highlight: `#B3E5FC`\n    *   Typography: Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\".\n\nAfter the code changes are implemented, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-21T21:34:18.778771"}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me read the current files to understand the structure better:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/profile.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now I'll implement the makeup recommendation app. Based on the requirements, I need to:\n\n1.
